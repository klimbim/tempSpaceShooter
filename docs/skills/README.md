# Skills — Context, Not Requirements

Skills in this directory are **not requirements**, **not tasks**, and **not a checklist**.

They do **not** describe features that must be implemented directly in code.

Instead, skills exist to:

- shape the **way of thinking** about systems
- provide **design intuition and mental models**
- reduce incorrect assumptions when designing or extending systems
- align decisions with the overall vision, principles, and constraints

A skill may influence:

- how a system is designed
- how trade-offs are evaluated
- how complexity is avoided

But a skill **does not need to be "fulfilled" or "implemented" explicitly**.

If a behavior or mechanic cannot be justified by:

- foundation documents
- directives
- constraints

then the presence of a related skill **does not make it valid**.

Skills are context.
Not obligations.
