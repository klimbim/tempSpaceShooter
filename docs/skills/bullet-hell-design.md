# SKILL — BULLET HELL DESIGN

## INTENT

Enforce readability, fairness, and intentional difficulty in bullet hell gameplay.

This skill biases design decisions toward patterns that can be learned,
read, and mastered by the player.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

- Difficulty comes from patterns, not randomness
- Player death must feel deserved
- Threats must be readable before they are lethal
- Complexity emerges from composition, not chaos

If a pattern cannot be read, it is not valid.

---

## PREFERRED PATTERNS

- Symmetrical or clearly structured bullet formations
- Repeating rhythms with variation over time
- Explicit phase-based escalation
- Telegraphing before high-pressure moments

Patterns should invite learning, not guessing.

---

## AVOID

- Random bullet spreads without structure
- Sudden, untelegraphed difficulty spikes
- Screen-filling noise without safe paths
- Overlapping patterns that obscure intent

If the player cannot identify why they died, the design is incorrect.

---

## DECISION RULES

When designing encounters:

- Prefer fewer bullets with clear intent over dense noise
- Prefer predictable motion over erratic behavior
- Prefer limited pattern sets reused creatively

Difficulty should scale by layering, not by confusion.

---

## WHEN TO USE

- Wave design
- Boss phases
- Movement and shooting pattern composition

Avoid using this skill for low-level systems or technical tasks.

---

## GOAL

Create encounters that feel intense yet fair,
rewarding skill, pattern recognition, and mastery.

The player should feel challenged, not cheated.
